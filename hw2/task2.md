# Task 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau
## Moving up a dimension
In the previous task, we described an algorithm for computing points on a Bezier curve based on a single parameter \\(t\\).
Now, we want to deal with a Bezier *surface,* which has a 2D grid of control points and two parameters \\(u, v\\).
From here, we can
