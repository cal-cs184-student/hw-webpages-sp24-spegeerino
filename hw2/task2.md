# Task 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau
## Moving up a dimension
In the previous task, we described an algorithm for computing points on a Bezier curve based on a single parameter \\(t\\).
Now, we want to deal with a Bezier *surface,* which has a 2D grid \\(n \times n\\) of control points and two parameters \\(u, v\\).
The way that we do this is to first treat each row of control points as a single Bezier curve with parameter \\(u\\) (reused for each curve generated by each row).
Then, applying de Casteljau's algorithm to each row will leave us with \\(n\\) points remaining, which we then can do one final iteration of de Casteljau with (this time with parameter \\(v\\)) to get a single point, which is on the Bezier surface.
This method of computing points on a Bezier surface is called *separable* 1D de Casteljau.
By "separation," we mean that we're operating on each parameter independently, sort of separating out the work we would otherwise have to do in 2D (since we're working with a surface).
## Some intuition
Conceptually, varying \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) both from 0 to 1 will parameterize the whole Bezier surface.
However, we can think of the "separability" of the surface by fixing just the parameter \\(u\\) (and letting \\(v\\) vary from 0 to 1), and stop the computation after we've reduced our \\(n \times n\\) points to just \\(n\\) points.
We can think of those \\(n\\) remaining points in terms of the Bezier curve they define purely in terms of the parameter \\(v\\).
If we let \\(v\\) range over its whole domain, we can get the whole Bezier curve corresponding to the value of \\(u\\) that we fixed before.
Then, as we vary the parameter \\(u\\), we get smoothly varying Bezier curves across the whole Bezier surface.

## What it looks like
This teapot render is made by sampling points on the Bezier surface using the de Casteljau algorithm and then constructing a triangle mesh out of those sampled points, then rendering the triangle mesh.
